# Project Description:
----------------------------------------

This assignment contains a collection of beginner-level Python programs designed to strengthen understanding of core programming concepts.

The programs cover:

- Variables and Data Types
- Conditional Statements (if-else, nested conditions)
- Loops (for, while)
- Functions
- String Manipulation
- Mathematical Computations
- Menu-Driven Programs
- Number System Logic
- Basic Game Implementation

Each program is written using structured logic with proper validations wherever necessary (e.g., division by zero handling, minimum balance validation in ATM simulator, invalid input checks, etc.).

----------------------------------------
Special Instructions:
----------------------------------------

1. Some programs are menu-driven and will continue running until the user chooses to exit.
2. The ATM Simulator maintains a minimum balance requirement.
3. The Temperature Converter and Calculator programs use function-based modular implementation.
4. The Random Number Guessing Game uses Python's built-in 'random' module.
5. All programs are written using only built-in Python libraries.
6. The entire assignment can be run as a single Python file.

----------------------------------------
Challenges Faced:
----------------------------------------

1. Handling edge cases such as division by zero and invalid user inputs.
2. Designing menu-driven programs that repeatedly execute until exit.
3. Implementing number system logic like Armstrong number, GCD (Euclidean algorithm), and Perfect number.
4. Managing nested loops for pattern printing.
5. Ensuring clean logic flow when multiple interactive programs are combined in a single file.

These challenges helped improve logical thinking and structured problem-solving ability.
